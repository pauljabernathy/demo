This directory contains a project to <a href="presentation.ipynb">analyze UFC fight data and predict winners</a>.  
So far, the best pre fight predictions I have been able to make are right about 60% of the time - better than chance but less accurate that the human odds makers, who were right about 67% of the time.  
Predictions of the winner based on data collected through the fight is much better (82 - 84 %), but that is an easier
 question.
