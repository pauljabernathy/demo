    "I once heard about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\">The Monty Hall Problem</a>, a riddle or brain teaser involving decisions based on probility.  In this scenario, a contestant on a game show is shown three closed doors and told there is a valuable prize behind one and a goat behind the other two.  (Assume the contestant does not value goats.)  They are given the chance to pick a door, and will receive the item that is behind the door.  However, after the contestant picks, the game show host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the doors the contestant did not pick to reveal a goat.  Now there is one door open (with a goat) and two remain closed, one of which is the contestant's choice.  The host gives the contestant an opportunity to keep their original pick or change, before all the doors are opened and the contestant gets the prize or a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, as this point, <b>is it better for the contestant to keep the original choice or change choices?  Or does it matter?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thare is a theoretical answer based on probability calculation.  I thought it would be fun to simulate it in code, to check the theoretical answer."

    "At the point of choosing to keep the original choice or change choices, are you more likely to get the prize by switching or keeping the original choice?"

    "I wrote a simple program to simulate the choice many times and add up how many times the contestant got the prize and how many times they got the goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the do_one_turn() function, a random door is chosen to be the prize door, and a random door is chosen, independently to be the original choice.  As in the game show, this has to happen <i>before</i> anything is revealed and a choice is changed.  Now, the door that is neither a choice nor a prize is opened to reveal a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "In half of the scenrios, the contestant choosed to switch doors.  In the other half they keep their choice."

    "## Explanation\n",
    "At the time the host opens a goat door and gives the contestant the chance to keep their original choice or change it, it is tempting to say that there is a 50 / 50 chance of the prize being being either door.  I am tempted by that also.  But you have to go back and look at the entire sequence of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of it all, there are three doors.  You don't know what is being each one.  At this time, whatever door you pick has a one in three chance of being the prize door.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the first goat door is removed in the next step, does that change the fact that, 10 seconds ago, you  had a one in three chance of picking the prize door?  No.  The past has not changed.  Your pick still has a 1/3 chance of being correct.  So the other door, the one that is still closed but was not your pick, must have a 2/3 chance of containing the prize.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I originally heard about this on a podcast, the speaker explained it by saying that it is as if, when the first goat door is opened, all it's probablity transfers over to the other door you did not pick.  Whether you prefer to think of it as a transfer or probability or the \"what's done is done\" way that I explained it, the point is that the theory says that it is in the contestant's best interest to switch their choice*.  And this simulation seems to perfectly agree with the theory."
