    "A Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov Chain.  \n",

    "I once heard something to the effect that if you have a given set of states with given transition probabilities, and you take random walks between those states, then the average time spent in each state and the likelihood of being in a given state at the end is independent of which start you start in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was to test that.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll test with three states, then we will increase the number of states.  For the examples with more states, we will use a toy example of a house with a person randomly going between rooms in the house.  I run simulation with many \"chains\" with each chain representing moving through the house to X number of rooms.  I track the list of rooms visited and also the last room visited.  A random room is chosen to start each chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of visits to each state (or room) are roughly the same as what would be predicted by the transition probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similary, the number of times each room is the last room in the chain is the roughly the same as would would be predicted by the transition probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportions of those last rooms will be roughly equal to the overall proportions of visits to each room.  That is, the number of times room A is the last room should be approximately to (number of visits to A) / chain length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what room you start in, the proportion in each room will be roughly constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these, will will use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test\">chi-square test</a> to test if the distributions are actually equal or not.\n",

In this scenario, if the frog is on liily pad A, it will jump to B with a probability of .7 and to C with a probability of .3.  It if is on B, it will jump to A with a probability of .7 and to with a probability of .3.  If it is on C, it will jump to either A or B with a probability of .5.\n",
