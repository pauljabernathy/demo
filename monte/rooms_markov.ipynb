    "In this toy example, there is a house with each room being adjacent to other rooms in the house.  I run simulation with many \"chains\" with each chain representing moving through the house to X number of rooms.  I track the list of rooms visited and also the last room visited.  A random room is chosen to start each chain.\n",
