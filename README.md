This repo is intended to be a demo of some Machine Learning concepts I have learned.

Right now, the only thing I have working is the small <a href="/diabetes/diabetes_presentation.ipynb">diabetes
 presentation</a>.  It is a
 short notebook about a rather small study, but it does contain training and testing of Logistic Regression, Random
  Forest, and Neural Network models.

Almost all of the code and notebooks in this repo are for a project I was working on to analyze UFC fight data and
 predict winners.  So far, the best predictions I have been able to make are right about 60% of the time - better
  than chance but less accurate that the human judges, who were right about 67% of the time.  So I put it aside
   and took up the diabetes dataset
  .  I don't know if I am doing the analysis incorrectly or if the data sets simply do not contain enough
   information.  The human fight promoters have access to information about the fighters that is not in the data sets.
  
I plan to revise the presentation notebooks for the UFC project soon (as opposed to all the scratchwook notebooks
) and post links here for if you are interested.
