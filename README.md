This repo is intended to be a demo of some Machine Learning concepts I have learned.

Right now, it contains two projects:

* the small <a href="diabetes/diabetes_presentation.ipynb">diabetes
 presentation</a>.  It is a
 short notebook about a rather small study, but it does contain training and testing of Logistic Regression, Random
  Forest, and Neural Network models.

* a project to <a href="ufc/presentation.ipynb">analyze UFC fight data and predict winners</a>.  
So far, the best pre fight predictions I have been able to make are right about 60% of the time - better than chance but less accurate that the human odds makers, who were right about 67% of the time.  
Predictions of the winner based on data collected through the fight is much better (82 - 84 %), but that is an easier
 question.


Upcoming changes:

* revisions to the UFC pages to make them easier to read
* at least one monte carlo simulation
* hopefully an analysis of US Presidential Election data to look at how the results would be different if electors
 were aggragated at the Congressional District level rather than the state level
